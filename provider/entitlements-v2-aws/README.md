# Entitlements V2 service
The OSDU on AWS energy data platform supports API and data authorization via the Entitlements service.
The users are assigned to service and data groups through which users gain access to APIs and data. The Entitlements service provides CRUD operations to manage groups and its members.
Entitlements Service supports hierarchical groups using a graph model.
entitlement-v2-aws stores groups/users in MongoDB.

## Running Locally

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites


* JDK 17 (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-17-ug/downloads-list.html)
* Lombok 1.28 or later
* Maven
* Install MongoDB on your machine by following this [link](https://docs.mongodb.com/v4.0/installation/)
* You may install mongo compass which is a MongoDB GUI using this [link](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)
* Navigate to where the mongo sever is installed and start the server using:
``C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin>mongod``

The server will start on the default port 27017
* Launch MongoDB Compass and create a new connection to localhost: 27017

### Run Locally
Check that maven is installed:

example:
```bash
$ mvn --version
Apache Maven 3.8.3 (ff8e977a158738155dc465c6a97ffaf31982d739)
Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.8.3/libexec
Java version: 17.0.7, vendor: Amazon.com Inc.
...
```

You may need to configure access to the remote maven repository that holds the OSDU dependencies. Copy one of the below files' content to your .m2 folder
* For development against the OSDU GitLab environment, leverage: `<REPO_ROOT>~/.mvn/community-maven.settings.xml`
* For development in an AWS Environment, leverage: `<REPO_ROOT>/provider/entitlements-v2-aws/maven/settings.xml`

* Navigate to the service's root folder and run:

```bash
mvn clean package -pl .,entitlements-v2-core,provider/entitlements-v2-aws -P core,aws
```

* If you wish to build the project without running tests

```bash
mvn clean package -pl .,entitlements-v2-core,provider/entitlements-v2-aws -P core,aws -DskipTests
```

After configuring your environment as specified above, you can follow these steps to run the application. These steps should be invoked from the *repository root.*
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: Replace `*` with version numbers as defined in the app pom.xml if not on osx/linux

```bash
java -jar provider/entitlements-v2-aws/target/entitlements-v2-aws-*.*.*-SNAPSHOT-spring-boot.jar
```

## Testing
 
 ### Running Integration Tests 
 This section describes how to run OSDU Integration tests (testing/entitlements-v2-test-aws).
 
* Before you begin accessing the APIs of this service, you need to first initialize a tenant with the entitlements groups.
  To do this, follow these steps: 
  1. Open a bash shell and set the following environment variables:
 ```
  export AWS_REGION=<YOUR_OSDU_DEPLOYED_REGION> (example:us-east-1)
  export LOCAL_MODE=true  
  export AWS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8082  
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>  
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>  
  export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<YOUR_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN>
  export $AWS_DEPLOYMENTS_SUBDIR=./devops/aws    
```
 3. Run the following command to initialize a tenant for service account:
   ```
   curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/entitlements/v2/tenant-provisioning' \
   --header 'data-partition-id: <YOUR_DATA_PARTITION_ID>' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \   
   --header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_FOR_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL>'
   ```
   Alternatively, look up the bootstrapping script in the devops/aws. This script initializes groups for three users used for 
   integration tests. 

```
  ./devops/aws/bootstrap.sh
  ```
  Re-running this script multiple times will not cause any undesired effects.
  
  After the successful execution of this script, you should see the following using MongoDB Compass:
  
  ![Groups](docs/img/mongodb_groups.png)
  
  
  
  
  ![Users](docs/img/mongodb_users.png)
  

  
* Next, you will need to have the following environment variables defined.
